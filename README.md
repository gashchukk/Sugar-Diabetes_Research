## About
I took a dataset from `Kaggle` which has a lot of data describing people and their health. But the most interesting about this dataset is that it is perfect for the Linear Regression modeling. Becasue it has precidtion based on each person heath. It calculates probability of person having a Sugar Diabetis based on his/her health
